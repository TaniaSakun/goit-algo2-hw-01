### Task 1: Finding the Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array
Develop a function that determines the smallest and largest elements in an array using the divide-and-conquer approach.

#### Requirements:
- The function should accept an array of numbers of any length as input.
- Recursion must be utilized.
- The function should return a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values.
- The algorithm should have a time complexity of O(n).

#### Results:
Array: [-88, -100, 3, -78, -40, -54, -63, -40, 41, 11, -30, -55, 64, 64, -99, -90]
Minimum element: -100, Maximum element: 64

### Task 2: Finding the k-th Smallest Element
Design an algorithm to locate the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array using the Quickselect method.

#### Requirements:
- The function must take an array of numbers and an integer k as inputs.
- A pivot selection strategy should be implemented.
- The entire array does not need to be sorted.
- The expected average time complexity should be O(n).

#### Results:
Array: [-98, 65, -20, -73, -54, -23, -33, 55, -73, 86, 31, -42, 16, 83, 42, -45]
6-th smallest element: -33
